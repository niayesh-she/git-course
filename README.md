this project is not finished. these are things left to do:
1. load images for featured scrolling tab.
2. apply the same functionalities (scrolling feature,
   movie detail rendering) as featured tab
   to Premieres and announcement tab.
3. make the search bar interactive.
4. create a detail page for each movie to
   show up when clicked (using url parameters).
